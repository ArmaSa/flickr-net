FlickrNet-Experimental
======================

Experimental repository for the next version of the FlickrNet API library.

Currently I am attempting to convert the library into a T4 based project, 
so that seperate DLLs can be created easily targetting different platforms.

For the current stable version go to http://flickrnet.codeplex.com 
or better still just download it from http://www.nuget.org/packages/FlickrNet.

Change Log
==========

September 2013: First initial checkins. 
Currently contains code for most public method calls for both .Net 4.5 and Windows 8
as seperate DLLs. Plan to retrofit .Net 2.0 in and add Upload support (the main missing feature) in the next few weeks.
